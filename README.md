RISK ASSESSMENT FOR COLAB KADUNA

Risk Assessment: CoLab Kaduna

Contextual Notes for CoLab Kaduna:
 * Location: Barnawa, Kaduna 
 * Services: Co-working space, innovation hub, talent acceleration programs, community events, meeting rooms, "constant power," "super fast Wi-Fi," library, lockers.
 * Users: Startups, innovators, creatives, entrepreneurs, students, developers, freelancers, visitors. This diverse user base introduces unique dynamics.
 * Local Infrastructure: Kaduna has seen improvements in internet access (3G, 4G, 5G widely available) and continuous efforts on power infrastructure, but reliability can still be a challenge.
 * Security Landscape in Nigeria: High prevalence of cybercrime (phishing, malware, ransomware, BEC), insider threats, and a growing need for cybersecurity awareness and skilled personnel. NDPR is crucial.
